# student-alumni-system
Student Profile and Alumni system is an information system which helps the students as well the Alumni to keep track of their records and also connect with each other. This system allows the students to maintain all the data related to their courses, events they belong to during the ongoing process and even after they have been graduated from a particular university. Right from registering into a course, monitoring and updating their own student profile, every data will be stored in the system, which makes it efficient and less cumbersome task instead of managing each and everyoneâ€™s student file. This can also help build a network between the current student and the alumni. The Alumni network also plays an important role in the development of the institution and the students. It helps the student to choose the right track for upgrading their skills. The events posted on the channels provided by the system will help to share the knowledge across platforms.
